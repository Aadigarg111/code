> Objective: Build a fully functional "Codestake - Friends and Finance" web application that helps coders stay accountable by staking money on coding goals. The app integrates blockchain (Ethereum/Polygon), GitHub/LeetCode APIs, and a peer-driven reward system with a gamified UI. --- üõ† Tech Stack & Dependencies Frontend: React.js (or Next.js), TailwindCSS (or Material UI) Backend: Node.js with Express.js Database: MongoDB (or PostgreSQL for relational data) Blockchain: Solidity for smart contracts on Ethereum/Polygon APIs: GitHub API (track coding activity) LeetCode/Codeforces API (verify challenges) Web3.js (for blockchain interactions) WalletConnect (MetaMask integration) --- üìå Features & UI Components 1Ô∏è‚É£ Onboarding & Authentication Container: SignUpScreen Buttons: "Sign up with GitHub" "Sign up with Google" "Connect Wallet (MetaMask/WalletConnect)" Inputs: Username Email Crypto Wallet Address Functionality: OAuth authentication with GitHub/Google Web3 wallet authentication Store user details in MongoDB --- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Home Dashboard (Main Screen) Container: DashboardScreen Sections: "Your Coding Streak" ‚Üí Animated progress bar tracking daily commits "Active Challenges" ‚Üí List of ongoing coding bets "Leaderboard" ‚Üí Shows top performers "Your Wallet Balance" ‚Üí Displays stake amount, rewards, penalties Buttons: "Join a Challenge" "Create a New Challenge" --- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Coding Challenge Container: CreateChallengeScreen Inputs: Challenge Name Coding Platform (LeetCode, GitHub, Codeforces) Number of Days Amount to Stake Invite Friends (Optional) Buttons: "Start Challenge" ‚Üí Calls smart contract function to lock stake Blockchain Functionality: Deploys a smart contract that holds the staked amount Tracks daily coding activity via GitHub API Releases funds only if the goal is met --- 4Ô∏è‚É£ Tracking Progress (Live Updates) Container: ProgressScreen Displays: Challenge Progress (Success %) GitHub Commit Graph Coding Activity from LeetCode API Smart contract "Proof of Progress" Buttons: "Extend Deadline (Subscription Perk)" "Withdraw Reward (On Challenge Completion)" --- 5Ô∏è‚É£ Payouts & Penalties Container: PayoutScreen If user wins: Shows "üéâ Success! Your stake + bonus is released!" Button: "Withdraw to Wallet" Calls smart contract function to send funds If user loses: "You lost your stake! Funds are distributed to peers." Shows where lost money is sent Button: "Try Again" --- 6Ô∏è‚É£ Subscription Model (Premium Perks) Container: SubscriptionScreen Perks Available: Deadline Extensions Challenge Re-entry Increased Rewards Payment Method: Crypto/NFT-based subscription Button: "Upgrade to Pro" --- üîó Smart Contract Logic (Solidity) createChallenge(stakeAmount, duration, userAddress) ‚Üí Locks funds trackProgress(userAddress) ‚Üí Checks GitHub API for commits releaseFunds(userAddress) ‚Üí Sends money back if goal is met distributePenalty(userAddress, peerGroup) ‚Üí Shares lost stake among others --- üìç Additional Enhancements ‚úÖ Real-time updates using WebSockets ‚úÖ Gamified UI (Dark Mode + Cyberpunk theme) ‚úÖ Multi-chain support (Ethereum L2 & Polygon) --- Final Output: A fully functional Codestake Web App with a secure blockchain-based betting system for coding, complete with user authentication, challenge tracking, financial rewards, and peer accountability.
